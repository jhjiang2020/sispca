*sispca* is a Python package designed to learn linear representations capturing variations associated with factors of interest in high-dimensional data. It extends the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to multiple subspaces and encourage subspace disentanglement by maximizing the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). The model is implemented in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and uses the [Lightning framework](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/) for training. See the [documentation](docs/source/index.rst) for more details.
